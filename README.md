## How it Works ?
Our project is a web app built on Html, CSS, and Js at the front end and node js and express libraries at the backend. the davinci text model from openAi is used for data generation. Data is generated by modifying the model's prompt with the values of location and budget.

prompt at the backend is given as: 
   `I need a complete travel plan with places to visit and food to try in for 3 Days in ${location} in  a budget of Rs${budget}.show the output day by day `;

The values of location and budget are taken input from the user as a form and passed to the prompt, thus generating the requiredÂ output.
